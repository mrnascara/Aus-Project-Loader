# Aus project Loader

first i should explain that this project started on penguinmod,as a a way to play .sb3,.pmp, sb2 & sb & more files types via a web browser,
However going foward there will be three different versions Beta,release,and web ,beta versions are released out weeks in advance and are often incomplete or have massive bugs meaning that they often have safety risks and arent safe,keep in mind i'll try to patch these risks but please keep it in mind that these versions could lead to "virus sb3 files" please get your sb3/pmp files off the offical scratch website(meaning please dont use any weird thrid party sites other than turnowarp,penguinmod,and gandi ide) web versions are versions for ios & android,currently ios doesnt have a "good" method of installing other than a html, ipa files are off the table due to the complex method that is jailbreaking and or sideloading, sure there are tools but the user probably doesnt want to have to jailbreak and or sideload to use the web versions and as the dev myself jit based is off for the same reasons(i really think the new iphone chips could make the experience better). furthermore heres the device support list/way to use it.

# Setup

IOS & android(no pc required): ok this method requires internet connect & microsoft edge so go to app store/google play and download edge then download the .html file and open in edge and your free to go.


Windows 10/11 PC(64 bit):this is assuming you have a 64 bit windows 10/11 pc, unzip the zip file & then run the .exe (sometime because the .exe isnt signed windows defender/any anti virus will get pissed off so you may have to make a exception) and your good to go

Windows 10/11 pc(32 bit/arm): unzip the .zip for your respective windows 10/11 variant (32 bit or arm) then run the .exe, you may have to make a exception for the exe for windows defender or any other antivirus...


macos: unzip the .zip file and run the .app file(due to antivirus shangians you may need to make a exception in your antivirus settings)


#   Info on PS3,3DS,and TI 84 plus ce python
I originally planned on porting this to the 3ds & ps3 as well,but i quickly realized this would mean REbuilding the WHOLE lapi framework for those devices & extreme devkitpro knowledge and a LOT of ps1light shenaniganes with additionally rebuilding the WHOLE penguinmod,snail ide,dinosaurmod,electramod,turbowarp & scratch runtimes.....which would require crazy knowledge,combined with id have to.....somehow MAKE a version useable for those versions......which unfornately i also thought about the TI 84 plus ce python......until i realized ti python is slow as crap & ti basic wouldnt allow for such controls of the cpu so c it is.....except that would require a jailbreak method,and a lot would have to be stripped down
# Aus project loader lite (APLL)
okay massive announcement.....introducing Aus project loader Lite (APLL) basically a version that allows for cpu access,currently this version doesnt have a release date yet,this version will mainally target linux 64 & 32 bit and linut mint,debian,ubuntu. please note that there are Way too many linux distros for me to mske versions for so some variants of linux may not work at all,additionally a lot of the APLL engine will be built into either asm(probably x86,64,arm,and nasm) and if your pc doesnt support asm at all,i might just release a js version that you run with node.js note that only the main linux versions will be targeted, meaning im not going to make a APLL version for a obscure version of linux from 2012.....
