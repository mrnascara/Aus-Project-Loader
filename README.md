Aus project Loader

first i should explain that this project started on penguinmod,as a a way to play .sb3,.pmp, sb2 & sb & more files types via a web browser,
However going foward there will be three different versions Beta,release,and web ,beta versions are released out weeks in advance and are often incomplete or have massive bugs meaning that they often have safety risks and arent safe,keep in mind i'll try to patch these risks but please keep it in mind that these versions could lead to "virus sb3 files" please get your sb3/pmp files off the offical scratch website(meaning please dont use any weird thrid party sites other than turnowarp,penguinmod,and gandi ide) web versions are versions for ios & android,currently ios doesnt have a "good" method of installing other than a html, ipa files are off the table due to the complex method that is jailbreaking and or sideloading, sure there are tools but the user probably doesnt want to have to jailbreak and or sideload to use the web versions and as the dev myself jit based is off for the same reasons(i really think the new iphone chips could make the experience better). furthermore heres the device support list/way to use it.

IOS & android(no pc required): ok this method requires internet connect & microsoft edge so go to app store/google play and download edge then download the .html file and open in edge and your free to go.


Windows 10/11 PC(64 bit):this is assuming you have a 64 bit windows 10/11 pc, unzip the zip file & then run the .exe (sometime because the .exe isnt signed windows defender/any anti virus will get pissed off so you may have to make a exception) and your good to go

Windows 10/11 pc(32 bit/arm): unzip the .zip for your respective windows 10/11 variant (32 bit or arm) then run the .exe, you may have to make a exception for the exe for windows defender or any other antivirus...


macos: unzip the .zip file and run the .app file(due to antivirus shangians you may need to make a exception in your antivirus settings)
